This is a fairly high traffic list for general discussion, both for users and developers.

**You must be subscribed to post to this list.** As an anti-spam measure, postings from non-subscribers are discarded silently.

This mailing list is also available on [Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.network.zeromq.devel).

If you wish to ask for help for your ØMQ programming issues on this list, then please:

* Do not post code fragments greater than a few lines, but use a pastebin.
* Do provide a fully working minimal test case for any bug or issue you wish to report.
* Do note the operating system, ØMQ version, and other relevant aspects.

### Announcements
zeromq-announce@lists.zeromq.org | [Subscribe](https://lists.zeromq.org/mailman/listinfo/zeromq-announce) | [View archives](https://lists.zeromq.org/pipermail/zeromq-announce)

This is a low traffic list for important announcements (new releases and so on).

## IRC

ØMQ developers and users hang out on the **#zeromq** channel on the [freenode IRC network](http://www.freenode.net/).

Peter Alexander maintains [a full log of the #zeromq IRC channel](http://travlr.github.com/zmqirclog/) going back to March 2010.

To connect to the network, configure your IRC client to use the **chat.freenode.net** server.

If you don't have an IRC client, we suggest you try [X-Chat](http://www.xchat.org/) (Linux, Windows and others) or [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) (MacOS X).
